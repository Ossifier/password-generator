# password-generator
This is a very simple password generator to act as practice to get me back into coding in Python. Thus far the code is quite simple, but will grow as I add additional functionality and convenience features in the future.

Thus far it is a fully functioning password generator that can be used so long as you have Python installed. This generator allows the user to select preferences for length of the password, number of letters, numbers, and special characters to be included, and the number of random passwords to be generated at once.

## TO DO:
1. Add password management functionality so not only can you generate and save passwords, but also retrieve them if you so choose.
2. Build a functioning GUI interface using tkinter.

## TO CONSIDER:
1. Add enhanced specificity that allows users to select which special characters, numbers, or letters they would like to include or exclude.
2. Add a dictionary functionality to allow users to generate passwords that can also pull words from a dictionary list (potentially stored as a JSON file).
3. Allow users to specify words or character lists they would like to use in generating their passwords.

## COMPLETED TO DOS:
1. Add the capability to write passwords to a .txt file. >>> Now writes to JSON.
